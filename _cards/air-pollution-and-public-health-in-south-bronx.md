title: "Air Pollution and Public Health in the South Bronx"

teaser: >
  South Bronx Unite is a local environmental justice organization that leads data advocacy projects to champion better air quality, public health, and green space access for residents in the Bronx neighborhoods of Mott Haven and Port Morris. This resource provides an overview of their efforts to document the longstanding industrial air pollution in the area that continues to afflict local residents' health. The organization contextualizes their comprehensive data visualizations with commentary about the political history and socioeconomic factors that have led to the current situation. In addition to having students explore the South Bronx Unite data advocacy website, it may also be helpful to have them read a couple of the news stories (collected on the "Press & Media" page) that reporters have written about the organization's efforts and their contribution to the borough's future plans and zoning policies.
