**Note:** This data visualization tool--accessible via the Connect2HealthFCC Task Force’s platform--is especially timely given the recent COVID-19 national public health emergency, when telehealth became increasingly critical to meeting the needs of Americans, especially those residing in rural areas. This experience shifted the way in which many Americans access healthcare. The 2023 release reflects an important expansion and update of the platform to include maternal health data and opioid mortality rates.  Additionally, the platform now provides more advanced visualizations and analytic functionalities. The updated architecture and methodology allow users greater flexibility and control, as the broadband health space evolves.
