title: Data Governance

teaser: >
  Data governance is best understood as both an organizational process and a structure that attempts to identify, address, and prevent problems with data in order to improve data quality through the creation of social-technical systems and enforcement of policies, roles, responsibilities, and procedures. Data governance is a continuous and iterative process of handling data throughout the information life cycle.
