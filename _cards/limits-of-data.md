title: "The Limits of Data"

teaser: >
  In this opinion piece for <i>Issues in Science and Technology</i>, philosopher C. Thi Nguyen argues that data creation is a process of decontextualization. Nguyen also explains the politics of classification and metrics and ultimately calls for a critical approach to data. This article provides an excellent introduction to critical data studies, although it does not use that term.
