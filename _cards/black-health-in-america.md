title: "Black Health in America: Exploring Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccination Data"

teaser: >
  This Data Advocacy project assists public health efforts to make visible existing racial disparities in our healthcare system, specifically in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. This project asks "Are Black people, who remain overrepresented among COVID-19 deaths, receiving sufficient access to the vaccines?" Data findings presented in a chart "help to visualize the gap between how many Black people are dying from COVID-19 and how many are receiving the vaccine."
