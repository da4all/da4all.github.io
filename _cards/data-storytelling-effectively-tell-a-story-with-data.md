title: "Data Storytelling: How to Effectively Tell a Story with Data"

teaser: >
   This article from Harvard Business School Online positions data storytelling as an essential soft skill that complements hard skills in data analytics. Author Catherine Cote invokes recent research psychology showing that, in most cases, human brains are wired to prefer making meaning out of stories rather than raw data. Emphasizing organizational communication and business contexts, the article offers a useful, quasi-literary framework for doing data storytelling that adopts concepts such as setting, character, and conflict. keywords:
