title: "Data Storytelling: How to Effectively Tell a Story with Data"

teaser: >
  In this brief article, Catherine Cote invokes recent research psychology to show that, in most cases, human brains are wired to prefer making meaning out of stories rather than raw data. Emphasizing organizational communication and business contexts, the article should also resonate with humanities students as it offers a useful, quasi-literary framework for doing data storytelling that adopts concepts such as setting, character, and conflict.
