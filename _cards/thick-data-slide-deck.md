title: "Thick Data"

teaser: >
  This slide deck introduces the concept of "thick data" (Wang 2013) using Clifford Geertz's classic example of the difference between a wink and a blink (or squint). It references both C. Thi Nguyen's "The Limits of Data" (2024) and Tricia Wang's "Why Big Data Needs Thick Data" (2013) and can reinforce concepts introduced to students via those readings, or else substitute for them.
