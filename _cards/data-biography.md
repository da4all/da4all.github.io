title: "Data Biography"

teaser: >
  In this assignment, students apply the concept of a "data biography" to analyze the history behind a particular dataset: the who, what, when, how, and why of the dataset and its creation. In doing so, they learn about the different interpretative filters that shape the historical trajectory of a dataset, from its initial collection to its availability and usability today.

## Part 1: Data Biography

Your assignment is to write a "data biography" about a historical dataset (borrowed from Heather Krause, ["Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data"](https://gijn.org/stories/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/)). This is the dataset you will be examining: [Philadelphia African American Census 1847](https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/paac/). I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset that addresses the following:

- **Introduce** the dataset and its contents. What kind of information is in there? How much data is there?
- **Where** did it come from?
- **Who** collected, processed, and made it available?
- **How** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **Why** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **How** is it stored today? How did you access it?
- **Potential problems** with the dataâ€”are there any limitations, biases, missing data or gaps, or ethical considerations to consider when using this data?

Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of these questions will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So "Who collected it?" needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.

## Part 2: Reflection

Based on your data biography of the [Philadelphia African American Census 1847 data set](https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/paac/), write 1-2 paragraphs in which you reflect on lessons this example could hold for working with historical data in order **to pursue contemporary data advocacy projects.** In your response, please draw on your analysis of how the data for the Philadelphia African American Consensus 1847 was collected, processed, and made available - as well as the potential problems you identified.
