The idea that `‘raw data’ is an oxymoron` comes from scholars Geoffrey Bowker, Lisa Gitelman, and Virginia Jackson. It is predicated on the foundation that data never exists in a “raw,” unfiltered form and is never a neutral representation of reality. Every time data is created, it already is interpreted in some way - including through choices about **what** to collect, **how** to collect it, how to **organize** it, and how to **store** it. By the time data is being used for analysis, it has already been “cooked” in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.
