teaser: >
  This online, open-source textbook provides an excellent introduction to digital mapping that includes topics such as reading, using, and creating maps. A central focus of the text is the relationship between cartography and broader societal and technological developments. It also includes topics related to geospatial data ethics, the history of maps and mapping, and maps as rhetorical devices. Instructors can select chapters in this book to provide students with essential background information and context before moving into more hands-on cartography instruction; the background material provided in this text will allow students to approach the task of making their own data-advocacy related maps with greater insight, sophistication, and integrity.
