title: Data Life Cycle

teaser: >
  The data life cycle refers to the reiterative processes of working with data during a particular project. While the states are often identified and arranged differently by various organizations, generally the different processes include: generation, collection, processing, storage, management, analysis, visualization, and interpretation. As noted by Tim Stobierski, "The data life cycle is often described as a cycle because the lessons learned and insights gleaned from one data project typically inform the next. In this way, the final step of the process feeds back into the first."
