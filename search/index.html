Then we can access adn manipulate this metadata using Liquid, which allows for logic statements, loops, etc. I’ve outlined a couple of examples below.List of domains for this card:If a. particular card falls within multiple domains/sub-domains. This is listing out the domains based on the frontmatter:Checking consistency of metadataWe can also do a quality control check to make sure that the domain that someone writes in a specific card is spelled correctly and lines up with one of the site-wide domains we’ve defined separately in the _data folder:The tag 'Understanding Data' IS an allowed domain.Filter other cards based on domainsThis list is generated using Liquid to get a list of cards that have the same domain name as this card ( ie. Understanding Data ).

Pandemic Tracking and the Future of Data. 489, https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pandemic-tracking-and-the-future-of-data/.(Transcript)Agenda Discussion: Public Health Data History (15 min) Activity 1: Exploring the COVID-19 Archive (20 min) Activity 2: Metadata and Contributing to the COVID-19 Archive (20 min.) Tutorial: Spreadsheet Practice (20 min)ActivitiesDiscussion: Public Health Data HistoryIn small groups: What lessons should be drawn from John Graunt’s study of the Bills of Mortality? Why was it a breakthrough and what were some of its limitations? What were some of the main challenges that the COVID Tracking Project ran up against? What solutions outlined in the second half of the podcast did you find most compelling? Which solutions seem hardest or easiest to implement? What are some of the issues around “aggregation” and “disaggregation” of data that are mentioned at the end of the podcast? Can you think of other examples in which these practices might impact data advocacy projects beyond race and public health?Activity 1: Exploring the COVID-19 ArchiveToday you will be examining A Journal of the Plague Year: An Archive of COVID-19, a digital archive project that aims to “document, curate, and preserve experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the historical record.”Instructor Note: This activity centers on the COVID-19 digital archive. This participatory project invites users to submit their own content to the archive. The digital archive format will likely be frustrating and confusing to navigate and understand for some students. This is part of the rapid-response nature of the project and is a useful jumping off point for thinking about the information contained in archives, how that information is collected and made usable, and their silences and gaps.Explore the ArchiveIndividually:Take several minutes and start to explore the website. As you do so, take notes on the following: What seems to be in here? How is it organized? How easy is it to find something you’re looking for? How easy is it to stumble upon something that interests you? What challenges are you facing as a user? Go to the “Advanced Search” page for the archive. Search for a topic that interests you. Scroll through the first 5-10 collection items that appear and choose one of them. What kind of information is included in an “item”? How does it seem to be organized? What questions do you have about the archive based on this first exploration?Whole class: Which types (images, written reflections, audio files, etc.) of submissions are most useful in painting a picture of this COVID-19 year experience? Why? Which types of submissions resonated the least with you? Why? What was the user experience like in navigating the archive?Silences in the ArchiveWhen examining any archive or dataset, it’s important to always be on the lookout for its silences - ie. not just what information is in there, but also what is MISSING. One way to approach this is to study the geographical coverage of an archive or dataset. For the COVID-19 Archive, we’re going to use the Global Pandemic Map to examine where its items came from..ve-iframe https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/WorldMap width=80% height=800pxIndividually: Start with the most zoomed-out global scale and zoom into particular regions of the world: what countries are MOST represented and LEAST represented? Zoom down to your particular school. How well represented is YOUR surrounding geographical area in the COVID-19 Archive. Is your geographical area well-represented or poorly represented in this archive? Why do you think this is the case? Explore uploaded items that are closest to your institution. What seems to be in there? Whose experiences are reflected in these items? Whose experiences and voices seem to be missing? Brainstorm a list of 5 items you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area.Activity 2: Metadata and Contributing to the COVID-19 ArchiveThe COVID-19 Archive is a collection of individual items (news articles, photographs, written memories, oral history recordings, etc.) about the pandemic. But to make these items discoverable, the archive has to also collect information about them. This is called “metadata.” Watch this short video to gain a better understanding of this concept:.ve-media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE width=70% caption=”The Metadata Librarian Explains Metadata” (December 4, 2014)Working in pairs: Share your brainstormed list of 5 items you thought of that you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area. Choose one item from your combined list to contribute to the archive. Note: although you can make your own information as a contributor anonymous, the item you choose will be publicly available. Think about the issue of privacy when selecting your item. Go to this page and fill out the template to contribute your item: Work as a group and try to reach a consensus on what to include in the different metadata fields to describe the item. Note: it is recommended that you check the box to share this story anonymously, unless you want your personal information linked to the item. Whole class debrief: Based on the video about metadata and your own experience in adding metadata to an item, what is the purpose of metadata and why is it important? What challenges did you have in writing the metadata for your item? What was the hardest part? Was anything frustrating or confusing?Tutorial: Spreadsheet PracticeYou’re going to practice your spreadsheet skills using a subset of data that was collected through The COVID Tracking Project - the same initiative you learned about in the podcast episode you listened to for today. The following Google Sheet contains a subset of data from the project (note: in order to make it easier to work with it does not include ALL the data that was collected by the project):.ve-iframe https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2xZ1ctyRLNfIBR0HfAp7oJ3fQBs2sUNya509E1kS_M/edit?usp=sharing width=80%Instructions: Make a copy of the Google spreadsheet Create a new, empty sheet (instructions) and name it lesson-2.4 In the original Google Sheet of COVID data, use a filter to only look at data from a single state (you can choose your home state or that of your school) Copy and paste this single state’s data into your newly created lesson-2.4 sheet. The column positiveIncrease is a daily report of new COVID19 cases (suspected and confirmed) in that state reported for that day. Sort your data by the positiveIncrease column to find out: what was the largest number of positive cases reported in a single day in your state and what date did that occur? The column hospitalizedIncrease is a daily report of the number of people who were admitted to a hospital for COVID19 on that day in your state. Sort your data by this column to find out: what was the largest number of COVID19 hospitalizations reported in your state in a single day and what date did that occur? Add a new column named allCases: write a formula in the first cell that adds up (ie. sum()) the daily positive cases (positiveIncrease) and daily negative cases (negativeIncrease) for that day. Autofill that formula all the way down your rows. Add a new column named percentPositive: write a formula that calculates the daily positive cases as a percentage of ALL daily cases (positive + negative) - ie. what percentage of test results were positive? Add a new column named hospitalizedToPositive: write a formula that calculates a ratio of the number of hospitalizations for that day vs. the total new positive cases for a day - ie. what percentage of of people testing positive for COVID were hospitalized?Whole class debrief:Instructor Note: It is easy to forget when working with these nice whole numbers that there was a very messy process behind their creation. The last new column in particular stands on pretty shaky ground. The debrief below pushes students to wrestle with gaps and limitations of datasets and the tradeoffs of trying to use imperfect data. Did you find anything interesting in working with the spreadsheet? Did anything surprise you? What are some public advocacy projects you could imagine using this data for? Think back to the podcast episode and the challenges faced by the COVID Tracking Project. How confident are you in the “results” of your exploration of the spreadsheet? Do you trust the numbers? Given its limitations, do you think this data is worth using for a data advocacy project? Why or why not?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Critical Data Studies: An Introduction</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full open access "Critical Data Studies: An Introduction" article here </p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Advocacy Op-Ed</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">You will be evaluated on the basis of your op-ed’s capacity to: demonstrate command of genre conventions and rhetorical tactics common to newspaper op-eds; incorporate your chosen organization’s data points as evidence in support of claims, appeals, and examples that are likely to resonate with general readers; craft a clear, well-structured argument that reflects the mission and values of their chosen data advocacy organization.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Biography</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Part 1: BiographyYour assignment is to write a “data biography” about a historical dataset. This is the dataset you will be examining: Philadelphia African American Census 1847. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset that addresses the following: Introduce the dataset and its contents. What kind of information is in there? How much data is there? Where did it come from? Who collected, processed, and made it available? How was it collected, processed, and made available? Why was it collected, processed, and made available? How is it stored today? How did you access it? Potential problems with the data—are there any limitations, biases, missing data or gaps, or ethical considerations to consider when using this data?Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of these questions will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So “Who collected it?” needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.Part 2: ReflectionBased on your data biography of the Philadelphia African American Census 1847 data set, write 1-2 paragraphs in which you reflect on lessons this example could hold for working with historical data in order to pursue contemporary data advocacy projects. In your response, please draw on your analysis of how the data for the Philadelphia African American Consensus 1847 was collected, processed, and made available - as well as the potential problems you identified.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Feminism</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Data Feminism" book here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Feminism</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Justice</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Dear Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Step 1: Choose your Data Brainstorm a list of ideas for aspects of your daily life that you might record over five days. They should be: Regularly recurring in the course of a day Not too frequent (ie. not “how many breaths I take”) Not too infrequent (ie. “how many times do I take a road trip”) Something you have to actively collect instead of passively being recorded through a device (ie. no step counters/heart rate monitors) Think about the logistics of how you would collect information for each of your different ideas. Are you going to use a notepad? Will you carry this with you all the time? Your phone? Do you need to record just a checkmark for each observation or more data - ex. text, numbers, etc.? Will you need to measure anything? Based on feasibility and your own interest, choose what you are going to collectStep 2: Collect the Data Come up with a plan for how you’re going to record your data Note: It might help to set periodic reminders Keep a running journal that documents the process of data collection. What challenges did you run into? Are you noticing any patterns?Step 3: Visualize the Data You will create a hand-drawn visualization that illustrates the data you recorded. You have free reign to take this in any direction you want Note: you will not be graded on the aesthetics/design of the visualization, but on the effort you put into it. Here are some inspirations from Dear Data: Week 01: A week of clocks Week 07: A week of complaints Week 14: A week of productivity/schedules Week 46: A week of books we ownStep 4: Write a ReflectionIn your reflection you should include the following: The question you decided to answer Some of the ideas you came up with when brainstorming and why you chose your final visualization method Observations about the process itself - challenges, patterns, adjustments, etc. (draw on your process journal) How did you arrive at the data visualization itself? What choices did you make in representing the data? What challenges did you run into and how satisfied are you with the result? How did this small-scale process of personal data collection compare to the “big data” approaches used by private companies, schools, or government agencies? What are some of your big takeaways about data assembly and how might you apply these to data advocacy topics?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Deconstructing a Published Map</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Students will be assigned into groups of 2-4 (depending on class size). Students are to find a published map that explores a social issue of interest (they may select a map from one of the websites in the assigned readings, but are not limited to these maps). In the final class, students will use their chosen maps as the basis for a class presentation that explores and analyzes this map from a rhetorical and data-advocacy perspective.In the presentation, they should discuss: The map’s rhetorical situation (author, audience, exigence, and purpose) The underlying data used to make the map; for instance, the biography and thickness of the dataset The patterns the map is portraying The map’s design elements, and why they think these elements were chosen. They should also critique these elements, and suggest ways in which the map’s design might be improved. What narratives the map might support How the map could be used in a data-based advocacy campaign What questions emerge from the map that future research could help to clarifyThey should also prepare some of their own discussion questions based on the map, and lead the class in a short discussion after their presentation. Presentations and discussions should last 15-20 minutes.Each group will also write a 4-5 page paper that analyzes the chosen map, and that addresses the questions listed above; if possible, they are encouraged to incorporate feedback received during the presentation and class discussion into the final papers.Note: Students are welcome to use a map that they already encountered from one of the sources discussed in class, but are by no means required to do so. If students are having trouble finding an appropriate map, they are encouraged to consult with the course instructor, or with a reference librarian. The instructor may also consider arranging a short learning session in which a librarian could provide general guidance on discovering a map appropriate for this assignment. For information on features of an effective oral presentation, students can be referred to the following resource: https://www.gvsu.edu/ours/oral-presentation-tips-30.htm.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Exploring Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">PART I:Using a spreadsheet program or a software platform for statistical analysis (such as R), access the dataset and answer the following questions: How does the dataset represent the phenomena under scrutiny? What variables does it include? Which of the variables are categorical? Which are numerical? How do the variables selected for inclusion impact the kinds of inquiry you can perform with the data? What kinds of values are embedded in the way the dataset presents its information? Pick a numerical variable–for example, “population,” “age_over_18,” “hs_grad,” or any other numerical variable you wish to explore–and create a histogram of the data to visualize the data distribution. (Note: You can create a visualization for the entire United States–encompassing every county in the country–or you could filter first for a particular state.) How are the data distributed? Using the same variable, calculate the mean, median, and mode. Are these three measures of central tendency relatively close to each other? If so, what does their proximity suggest? If not, what does their relative difference tell you about the distribution of the observations that make up the dataset? Using the same variable, locate the maximum and minimum values. Calculate the interquartile range. Finally, calculate the standard deviation for your variable. Using the information about central tendency developed above, describe how your data are dispersed. Do the observations cluster around a central point? Are they relatively spread out? Choose another numerical variable and calculate the correlation between it and the initial variable you’ve studied. Interpret the r coefficient for these two variables. Does the r statistic indicate a strong or weak positive correlation, a strong or weak negative correlation, or no correlation? Why might this be? What might account for the relative correlation or non-correlation?PART II:Reviewing the calculations and reflections above, consider how these insights might inform a data advocacy project. For this part of the assignment, write a brief reflection focused on how your exploration of the ACS dataset might help support a data advocacy project. Your reflection should include two components: Brainstorm answers to the following questions, which build on your analysis from part one. What opportunities for further inquiry does your initial exploration help you identify? What kinds of power dynamics, structural inequities, or potential injustices might your analysis help identify? What kinds of information, including contextual and historical information, would be useful to help you answer these questions? Describe a data advocacy project that responsibly would build on the insights you’ve generated. What kinds of policy changes–including policies about data categories, data collection, and data use–might the insights you’ve generated help support? What kinds of challenges or injustices does your preliminary statistical analysis help identify? What kinds of help and input would you need to develop a data advocacy project?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Formal Critical Reflection: Defining Data and Doing Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Please write a 5-7 page formal reflection in which you a.) reflect back on your learning in this module and articulate what you have learned about data, the data life cycle, and best practices for doing data advocacy; and b.) apply this learning to analyze and comment on a contemporary enactment of data advocacy called Mapping Police Violence.This reflection has been divided into two parts. In writing your reflection, please make sure to attend to the questions posed below for each respective section. Note: Your tone may be casual in this reflection, but please write a substantive reflection that demonstrates deep understanding of the concepts, ideas, and frameworks covered in this module.Part 1:Revisit Journal Entry 1 and your prior conceptions about data. Reflect upon and write about where your thinking is now regarding what data is. What new or altered definition of data might you now offer? How has your perception of data changed? And why is this newer conception important to your understanding of doing data advocacy?Please also identify how you understand the data life cycle and its relevance to doing data advocacy. Along the way be sure to identify some of the best practices for doing data advocacy that you think are most important.Part 2:Please refamiliarize yourself with the three interconnected frameworks we covered during this module: data feminism, rhetorical data studies, a data equity framework. Drawing on concepts, ideas, lessons, and commitments gained from the readings about each of these frameworks, analyze and comment on We the Protestor’s Mapping Police Violence Project, which is part of their Campaign Zero Project.For your analysis, be sure to investigate We the Protestors and goals of the Campaign Zero project; read the description about the project (link at bottom of homepage) and consider the context in which this project was produced; learn about the research and resources, read about the methodology, and check out the data set (links at top of home page), and, of course, peruse the data visualizations (on the home page). As you study this project, put the three frameworks you learned about during this module to work to analyze the Mapping Police Violence Project. Pay close attention to: the designers’ exigence, audience, and purpose; what kinds of data were generated and how they were collected, analyzed, and presented; the multimodal choices and appeals made to produce the data advocacy website; what information was made salient and what information was excluded; whose voices and concerns were prioritized; how the designers negotiated the visual politics of accountability; how the designers attended to the data life cycle; and how the designers made (or did not make) ethical choices all along the way.Based on both your analysis and drawing on ideas, concepts, and lessons from the readings, how would you describe and evaluate the Mapping Police Violence project?

How does it relate to issues of power, ethics, or justice? Who are the intended audiences? (In other words, who needs to hear this story, and who is in a position to do something about it?) What effect do you want the redesigned visualization to have on those audiences?Then, write a point-by-point comparison of the two visualizations, explaining what each does well and poorly (and hopefully why yours outperforms the original). Write 3-4 sentences for each of the following aspects: the story in the data appropriateness of graphic elements decoration vs design appropriateness of comparisons use or misuse of common visual conventions appropriateness of frame of reference</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Interview with Catherine D’Ignazio: 'Data is Never a Raw, Truthful Input – and It is Never Neutral'</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Interview with Catherine D’Ignazio" article here </p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Mapping Police Violence</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Philadelphia African-American Census 1847</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Philadelphia African-American Consensus 1847" dataset here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Principles for Advancing Equitable Data Practice</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Foundations of Data Equity" article here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">A Rhetorical Data Studies Approach to Data Advocacy and Data Storytelling</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Sample Citation: “Gries, Laurie.
