title: "Gun Ownership and Gun Deaths"

teaser: >
  This presentation surveys and critically reflects on statistics associated with gun violence, such as why gun owners claim to carry guns and the paradox that people often carry guns to feel safer out of fear that other people might have guns. Blending big data visualization with tragic stories of specific gun deaths, this presentation seeks to add statistical evidence and emotional appeals to advocate for more strict gun regulations.
