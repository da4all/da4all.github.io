This student work was created by a group of students in a Fall 2024 upper-division writing course called "Advocating with Data." It was drafted in stages and workshopped with feedback from peers and the instructor. The assignment prompts can be found in the Toolkit:

Note that the website was built in Squarespace and then [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20250315153708/https://guava-penguin-6lbp.squarespace.com/) via the Wayback Machine, which did not perfectly preserve all aspects of the original website.
