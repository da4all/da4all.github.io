teaser: >
  The World Happiness Report 2023 website presents the 11th edition of this annual publication, which measures and ranks countries based on their citizens' happiness and well-being. The report includes several chapters covering topics such as trust and social connections during crises, state effectiveness, altruism's impact on well-being, and using social media to measure well-being across cultures and time. The site provides access to the full report, its executive summary, individual chapters, and downloadable data sets used in the analysis. It emphasizes the growing importance of happiness as a metric for national success and governmental objectives. The report is a collaborative effort involving various organizations and is edited by prominent researchers in the field. The website also offers information about the report's background, methodology, and ways to explore the data further.  We present this resource as an Example Project.
