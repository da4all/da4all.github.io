title: "Write Your Own Data Advocacy Values Statement"

teaser: >
  This activity asks students to consider their values before embarking on a data advocacy project (group or individual). It asks them to read the Appendix "Our Values and Our Metrics for Holding Ourselves Accountable" at the end of Data Feminism and then use it as inspiration to create the initial draft of a values statement that articulates their own primary concerns for how to avoid ethical transgressions during their project.

### Instructions for Students
For next class, read [“Our Values and Our Metrics for Holding Ourselves Accountable”](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/3hxh4l8o/release/2), the first appendix at the end of *Data Feminism*. Consider your own values. What practices, processes, and ideals are you willing to commit to in your own data advocacy project this semester? Using "Our Values and Our Metrics" as inspiration, **create a rough draft of a values statement** tailored to your group's project. Each member of your group will create a draft independently, and then you'll discuss as a group and use the independent drafts as raw materials to craft your group's official values statement together.

Feel free to look up (and link to) some other data advocacy values statements online if you want more models.
