## Description

Data Advocacy for All is an open-access educational toolkit that leverages minimal computing and open-source resources to enhance student abilities to inquire with data, communicate with data, and deploy data for social advocacy. The project has been designed for teachers and students across the disciplines with no prior data science or computing experience. This digital repository offers reading resources, ready-made data sets, tutorials, links to open-source tools, and flexible curricular resources such as activities, assignments, and modules.

Data Advocacy for All is a <a href="https://www.cu.edu/oaa/academic-innovation-programs/cu-next-award">CU Next Award Grant project<a/> that has been realized by a team of digital rhetoric and digital humanities faculty at the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Colorado Denver in concert with the CU Boulder's Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS).
