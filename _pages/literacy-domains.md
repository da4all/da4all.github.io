In the context of data the Data Advocacy for All project, **Data Literacy** is understood to be a nexus of mindsets, abilities, and practices that enable one to **advocate with data in meaningful, ethical, and transformative ways**. When it comes to data advocacy, we have identified three crucial literacy domains in which students need to gain experience in order to develop the critical-rhetorical capacities to ethically and effectively work with data to instigate social change. As evident in the chart below, we identify these three broad **domains** as [Understanding Data]({{site.baseurl}}/understanding-data/), [Processing Data]({{site.baseurl}}/processing-data/), and [Persuading with Data]({{site.baseurl}}/persuading-with-data/), and in each arena, we have identified four **subdomains**:

<img src="../assets/img/literacy-domains.png" alt="The graphic is titled 'Literacy Domains of Data Advocacy.' Beneath that heading, there are three primary domains: (1) Understanding Data, (2) Processing Data, and (3) Persuading with Data. Under each domain are four subdomains. Under (1) Understanding Data, there are the following subdomains: (1a) Defining Data, (1b) Critiquing Data, (1c) Acting Ethically with Data, and (1d) Thinking Rhetorically about Data. Under (2) Processing Data, there are the following subdomains: (2a) Collecting Data, (2b) Preparing Data, (2c) Analyzing Data, and (2d) Storing and Preserving Data. Under (3) Persuading with Data, there are the following subdomains: (3a) Making Claims with Data, (3b) Visualizing Data, (3c) Mapping Data, and (3d) Telling Stories with Data." width="100%" style="border: #9AB1DA 1px outset">

As so organized, these literacy domains are presented as distinct and linear. But we envision these domains as **overlapping and reciprocal**. When we create maps with data, we are often telling stories. When we tell stories with data, we are often thinking rhetorically and using persuasive devices. However, for the sake of organization, we have separated out these domains so that you, as teachers, can think about each of these domains more deeply and find relevant resources as needed:

      <p class="card-text">“Understanding data” is a literacy domain for helping students develop the critical, ethical, and rhetorical impulses needed to define data; understand its complicated relations to power, privilege, oppression, and liberation; and imagine ethical and responsible ways of working with data toward more just futures. We have broken this domain into four areas: defining data, critiquing data, acting ethically with data, and thinking rhetorically about data.</p>

      <p class="card-text">“Processing data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students learn how to perform various operations on data so that they can extract valuable insights from data in critical and ethical ways. Processing Data is often understood to be an iterative cycle involving several phases. For the purposes of this project, we identify four key phases: collecting data; preparing data; analyzing data; and storing and preserving data.</p>

      <p class="card-text">“Persuading with Data” teaches students how to generate persuasive data-driven content to assist advocacy aims for diverse contexts, purposes, and audiences. Persuading with Data is a multi-modal affair, meaning that not only does data often come in various forms (numerical, imagistic, spatial) but data is also commonly communicated in different mediums (words, sounds, images, etc.) to achieve various aims. To help students the multi-modal way of persuading with data, we offer resources on: making claims with data; visualizing data; mapping data; and telling stories with data.</p>
