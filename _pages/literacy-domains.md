Data Advocacy for All has designed our toolkit around three key literacy domains in which students need to gain experience to develop the critical-rhetorical capacities to ethically and effectively work with data to instigate social change.

> _A **literacy domain** is a specific area or aspect of literacy development that encompasses certain mindsets, abilities, and practices that enable one to advocate with data in meaningful, ethical, and transformative ways._

We identify these three broad domains as [Understanding Data]({{site.baseurl}}/understanding-data/), [Processing Data]({{site.baseurl}}/processing-data/), and [Persuading with Data]({{site.baseurl}}/persuading-with-data/), and in each arena, we have identified four **subdomains** of knowledge, abilities, and skills:

<img src="../assets/img/literacy-domains.png" alt="The graphic is titled 'Literacy Domains of Data Advocacy.' Beneath that heading, there are three primary domains: (1) Understanding Data, (2) Processing Data, and (3) Persuading with Data. Under each domain are four subdomains. Under (1) Understanding Data, there are the following subdomains: (1a) Defining Data, (1b) Critiquing Data, (1c) Acting Ethically with Data, and (1d) Thinking Rhetorically about Data. Under (2) Processing Data, there are the following subdomains: (2a) Collecting Data, (2b) Preparing Data, (2c) Analyzing Data, and (2d) Storing and Preserving Data. Under (3) Persuading with Data, there are the following subdomains: (3a) Making Claims with Data, (3b) Visualizing Data, (3c) Mapping Data, and (3d) Telling Stories with Data." width="100%" style="border: #9AB1DA 1px outset; margin-top: 1em;">

<div style="background-color: #e5eeff; margin-left:10px; margin-top:10px; margin-right:10px;"><p style="font-size: 14px; padding: 20px;"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> This graphic showcases how all of the literacy domains of data advocacy are interrelated, including each of the three primary domains in navy—Understanding Data, Processing Data, and Persuading with Data—as well as the subdomains beneath each one in red.</p></div>

As so organized, these literacy domains are presented as distinct and linear. But we envision these domains as **overlapping and reciprocal**. When we create maps with data, we are often telling stories. When we tell stories with data, we are often thinking rhetorically and using persuasive devices. However, for the sake of the toolkit's content and organization, we have separated out these domains so that you, as teachers, can think about each of these domains more deeply and find relevant resources as needed.
