Despite living in a data-rich world, too few students are being taught how to responsibly work with that data to
to advance equity and justice. Data Advocacy for All fills this gap. It offers a collection of resources for teaching **data advocacy** - an ethical and rhetorical practice of analysis, design, and communication in which data is used to drive social change. This site compiles ready-to-use teaching materials that help students:

- **Analyze** data critically and ethically
- **Build** skills in data collection, analysis, and visualization
- **Create** compelling data stories and arguments that drive real-world action

Data Advocacy for All offers [a toolkit]({{site.baseurl}}/toolkit) of flexible curricular [resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resource-types/) - including open-access readings, activities, assignments, and lesson plans - organized under three [literacy domains]({{site.baseurl}}/literacy-domains/) of data advocacy. Our toolkit has been designed around several [critical frameworks]({{site.baseurl}}/methodology/) and built for teachers and students across different disciplines who have no prior data science or computing experience.

# Our Mission and Framework

Data Advocacy for All defines data advocacy as a deeply ethical and rhetorical practice of integrated analysis, design, and communication in which insights from a dataset are effectively gleaned and conveyed to raise public awareness and drive social change. In attempt to hone students’ abilities to advocate with data in ethical, critical, and persuasive ways, Data Advocacy for All draws on three frameworks: critical data studies, data science, and rhetorical data studies.

# The Literacy Domains

The Data Advocacy for All toolkit is centered around three literacy domains: understanding data, processing data, and persuading with data; each of these three domains includes four subdomains. You can learn more about the three literacy domains of data advocacy on [the overview page](../literacy-domains/)—or you can navigate directly to any domain of interest.

# The Toolkit

The Data Advocacy for All toolkit is a collection of open-access educational resources for teaching data advocacy in higher educational settings. These resources have been curated by the Data Advocacy for All team in order to enhance student abilities to inquire with data, communicate with data, and deploy data for social advocacy. The toolkit includes open-access readings, assignments, activities, and other teaching resources.
