In our data-rich world, data advocacy has become a valuable literacy practice for communicating information and manifesting change. Yet too few students are being taught how to responsibly collect and use data to advocate for social change. **Data Advocacy for All** addresses this curricular gap by offering a toolkit of ready-to-use teaching materials that help students:

- **Think** critically and ethically about data and its societal impact
- **Build** skills in data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization
- **Create** compelling stories and arguments that translate data into real-world action

Data Advocacy for All's resources have been specifically designed for teachers and students across multiple disciplines who have no prior data science or computing experience. Inspired by three [critical frameworks]({{site.baseurl}}/methodology/) and centered around three [literacy domains]({{site.baseurl}}/literacy-domains/) of data advocacy, this digital repository offers [a toolkit]({{site.baseurl}}/toolkit) of flexible curricular resources including open-access readings, activities, assignments, and lesson plans.
