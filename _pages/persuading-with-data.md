## Overview

“Persuading with Data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students learn how to generate persuasive data-driven content to assist advocacy aims for diverse contexts, purposes, and audiences.

Persuading with Data is a multi-modal affair, meaning that when it comes to data advocacy, not only does data often come in various forms (numerical, imagistic, geolocational) but data is also commonly woven together with various resources for communication (words, sounds, images, etc.) to achieve various aims. To help students learn the various multi-modal ways one can persuade with data for advocacy purposes, we offer resources that specifically focus on: making claims with data; visualizing data; mapping data; and telling stories with data.

The resources offered under this literacy domain focus on these and other important questions:

- How can rhetoric—the art of persuasion—inform and enhance our data advocacy efforts?
- How can we use data to make emotional, ethical, and logical appeals to help achieve our advocacy aims?
- How can data visualizations and maps be responsibly used to assist our advocacy efforts?
- How can we tell ethical, effective, and affective data-driven stories to achieve our various rhetorical aims?
